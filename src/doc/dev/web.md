# Web stack

* [Hunchentoot](https://github.com/edicl/hunchentoot) for web serving.
* [Easy-routes](https://github.com/mmontone/easy-routes) sits on top of hunchentoot.
* [Djula](https://quickref.common-lisp.net/djula.html), a Common Lisp port of the Python Django templating engine, is used for rendering.

# Getting book information

This is done either with Dilicom's "FEL Ã  la demande" SOAP service, either with some web scraping.

# VueJS

## Variable interpolation with Djula and Vue

Both Djula and Vue use `{{ ... }}` for variable interpolation. To render Vue variables, use its built-in workaround: ``{$ {{ ... }} $}`.

# HTMX

- `hx-boost` really makes pages snappy. It needs to grab a full-HTML result.
  We can use it, as of today:
  - on the navbar, to pre-load the new card form (doesn't use JS so far).
  - on the main menu: Stock, Search, History (so far at least). It is really great, pages take 5ms to display!!!

  However, pages that rely on JavaScript (Vanilla, Vue) or that lead
  to dynamic results can NOT be "boost"ed.
  - can't boost the Sell page :/
  - on a card page, don't boost the click on the shelf search, because the target can be changed by the select input, but not the boost result, or if we stay a long time on the page, we'll see old results of this query. Damn!

# Vue

Sell page, Reception page.

We need to add the entered ISBN on the page as soon as possible, and
wait for the server on the background.

I tried a bit to use HTMX websockets.
