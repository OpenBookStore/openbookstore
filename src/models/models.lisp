(export '(*print-details*))

#|
Usage:

(connect)

(make-book :title "antigone" :datasource "xxx")

(save-book *)

(find-dao 'book)
;; => #<Book antigone>

Design notes
============

A book's title, authors and publisher fields also get a -ascii
equivalent (without accentuated letters). The ascii field is used for
searches. This method was thought the most portable.
