OpenBookStore web client


# Searching books

The command line interface allows to search by keyword with some web scraping.

The web interface currently allows to search one ISBN on Dilicom

When searching books in the "Search" menu, we get:

- the title, authors, publisher, price
- if this book is already in our stock, how many copies we have.

## Dilicom

Dilicom is a french book data provider.

With "FEL Ã  la demande" we can search by ISBN, and not do a free search.

We can't get the cover nor the summary either.


# Seeing one's stock

We can search our stock with the "Stock" menu.

Click on a search result to see its own page.

# Adding books

On a book's page, use the "+1" (and even "-1") button.

TODO: on search results, use these buttons too.
