OpenBookStore web client


# Searching books

The web interface currently allows:

- to search one ISBN on Dilicom
- to search by keyword with some web scraping (currently on a french datasource).

When searching books in the "Search" menu, we get:

- the title, author(s), publisher, price, URL to the cover, date of publication
- if this book is already in our stock, how many copies we have.

## Dilicom

Dilicom is a french book data provider.

With "FEL Ã  la demande" we can search by ISBN, and not do a free search.

We can't get the cover nor the summary either, but we have additional information:

- the availability


# Seeing one's stock

We can search our stock with the "Stock" menu.

We can click on a search result to see the book's own page.


# Adding books

On a book's page, use the "+1" (and even "-1") button.

TODO: on search results, use similar buttons.
