# Installation

There are a couple system dependencies to install.

On Debian: `apt install rlwrap sqlite3`

## Download a binary (WIP)

Download the executable from https://gitlab.com/myopenbookstore/openbookstore/-/pipelines (download a build artifact with the button on the right).

It's a 24MB self-contained executable (for Debian GNU/Linux,
x86/64). You don't need to install a Lisp implementation nor anything
to run it.

## Run from sources

Alternatively, install `sbcl` with your package manager:

    apt install sbcl

install Quicklisp, the Lisp library manager ([full instructions](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/#installation)):

    curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp && sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' --eval '(ql:add-to-init-file)' --quit &> /dev/null
    rm quicklisp.lisp

clone the repository:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/myopenbookstore/openbookstore.git

Then, to run the software, you have 2 options: build a binary or run it from sources.

# Running it

## Web UI

To run the web application:

- run it from the binary. Either download it from GitLab either build it (`make build`), then run it:

```
./bookshops -w [--port 8989] [--verbose]
```

- run it from sources:

```
make run
```

aka `rlwrap sbcl --load run.lisp`. You can set the port with the environment variable `OBS_PORT` (defaults to 4242).

Quit with `C-d`.

- run it from the REPL:

```
(bookshops-web:start-app :port 4242)
```

- initialize the database if not already done, see above.

## Command line

We can run OpenBookStore without a graphical interface.

We can use it to search for books data on internet sources:

    $ ./bookshops search terms

see `--help` for the available options.

## Readline interface

We can use OpenBookStore with a simple readline-based terminal interface.

Get a readline interactive prompt with the `-i` flag:

```
$ ./bookshops -i
bookshops >
```

See the available commands with `help`, the documentation of a given command with `help <cmd>` (see `help help`, use TAB-completion).

At any moment, quit the current prompt with `C-d` (control-d) or use:

- `quit`

To search for books on the internet sources, use `search`:

![](search-add.png)


## Lisp REPL

We can start OpenBookStore from a Common Lisp REPL, from our preferred editor, and modify it on-the-fly. The editor can be Emacs with Slime, Atom with SLIMA, Vim with Slimv, VSCode with Alive etc.

Load the system definition, `bookshops.asd`, with C-c C-k in Slime,

Load the dependencies: `(ql:quickload "bookshops")`,

Create the DB: `(bookshops.models::initialize-database)`

Create a superuser: `(bookshops.models::create-superuser name email password)`

Connect to the DB: `(bookshops:init)`

then explore commands in `bookshops.commands`.

You might need to enable terminal colors with `M-x slime-repl-ansi-on` ([see here](https://github.com/enriquefernandez/slime-repl-ansi-color)).

## Run at startup with Systemd

In a new `/etc/systemd/system/openbookstore.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=OpenBookStore

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
WorkingDirectory=/home/you/path/to/repository
# We run the binary: (abstolute path)
ExecStart=/home/you/path/to/repository/openbookstore --web --port 4242
User=openbookstore  # or an existing user
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target  # start at reboot.
```

start it:

    systemctl start openbookstore.service

to see the logs:

    journalctl -u openbookstore.service [--since today] [--no-pager] [-o json-pretty] [-f]

use `-f` to follow the logs as they are written.


# Usage

If you use the web app, you should find your way. Below is an overview on the available commands of the terminal interface.

## Bibliographic search, adding books to your stock

You can begin to search for books:

- `search <search terms or ISBN>`

It fetches bibliographic information on online sources and prints a
list of results. Add one to your stock:

- `add <i>`

Or create a book manually:

- `create`

To cancel the form, use `C-d` (control-d), or enter nothing in a
mandatory field (showed like in web forms with a red asterisk).

See also

- `delete <i>`

## Seeing the stock, pagination

To see your stock:

- `stock [keyword]`, with an optional keyword you can **filter by titles**.

This prints a list of results with at most `*page-size*` elements. Use
the two commands for pagination:

- `next` and
- `previous`.

To see more information about one book you have in stock:

- `details <id>`: print more information about the book of
 id `<id>`.
- `details <Title>`: you can TAB-complete the title.

As with several commands, you can autocomplete the id argument using
the TAB key. The choices are the ids displayed on the last `stock`
command, so this can be handy when you have filtered the results.

## Places

When you start the program, you are in the "default place". See that
the command prompt displays `(default place) bookshops > `: it shows the
current place you are in.

This current place plays the role of the *origin place* for the mentioned commands below.

To create a place, use

- `create place` (use TAB-completion, you currently have the choice between "book" (by default) or "place")

To change the current place:

- `inside [place]`: print the current place we manipulate the books
  from. With an optional argument, change to it (use TAB completion for the name of the places).

To move a book to another place:

- `move <book id> place [xi]`: move a book to another place. The place of origin is the one we are currently in (see `inside`). Give the quantity to move with for example "x2" at the end of the query. Example: `move 3 bedroom x2`.

See the list of places:

- `places`: lists the existing places with their number of books and their total cost.

## Lending books to contacts

Lend a book to someone:

- `lend <id> <contact name>`

See your contacts, their books and the date they borrowed them:

- `contacts`

The same information, but a list of books sorted by date (oldest first):

- `loans`

In both commands, a book that was borrowed more than 60 days is
printed in red.

and when your friend returns a book back:

- `receive <book id> [optional contact name]`


## Stats

Get some numbers about your stock:

- `stats`: some numbers. Percentage of books without isbn. With optional parameters to print the related results:
  - `noisbn`: prints the books that have no isbn.
  - `negative`: prints the books that have a negative stock, and
    where. This can happen if you move some books but you forgot to
    register them.


## Settings

The parameters can be changed with `set`.

The follownig settings currently exist:

- `*page-size*`


# High-level goals

  - etc


## i18n

This software is available in other languages than english.

See the makefile and `i18n-load` in `utils.lisp`.


# Dev

We use (our) `replic` library to build the readline commands from existing Lisp functions:
https://github.com/vindarel/replic (which builds on cl-readline).

We use the [Mito](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito) ORM. See the [Cookbook tutorial](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/databases.html).

<!-- ## Management commands -->

<!-- You can use: -->

<!-- - `manage <custom_command>` -->

<!-- to run custom commands. -->

<!-- And you can see some basic instructions on how to create your own commands -->
<!-- on file "src/manager.lisp" -->


## Testing

To test DB operations, use our macro `with-empty-db`.


```lisp
(use-package :bookshops.models)
(use-package :bookshops-test.utils)

(with-empty-db
   (let* ((bk (make-book :title "inside-test")))
     (save-book bk)))

;;  CREATE TABLE "book" (
;;     "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
;;     "datasource" VARCHAR(128),
;;     "title" VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
;;     "price" INTEGER,
;;     "date_publication" VARCHAR(128),
;;     "editor" VARCHAR(128),
;;     "authors" VARCHAR(128),
;;     "quantity" INTEGER,
;;     "created_at" TIMESTAMP,
;;     "updated_at" TIMESTAMP
;; ) () [0 rows] | EXECUTE-SQL
#<BOOK inside-test>
```

## Troubleshooting

- `DB is locked`: close and re-open: `(mito:disconnect-toplevel)` and `(bookshops.model:connect)`. => [fixed upstream](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito/pull/28#issuecomment-377450798) ?
